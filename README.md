# To-Do jQuery
This project was started in our Javascript course. Objective of this project was to create a jQuery version based on one of our previous projects. I chose to remake my previous To-Do list which was created with basic Javascript (Link 3). 

# Features

1. User can write to input field.
2. After pressing the "+" sign in the webpage the app will create a new task in the to-do list. 
3. After the task is done user can press the check field on the task and mark it done.
4. After task is finished user can delete it using the trash can symbol.
